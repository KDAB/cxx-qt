/// # Safety
///
/// This is a marker trait used to disable locking.
///
/// By default, CxxQt will guard all access to the generated QObject with a recursive mutex.
/// For performance reasons it may be desirable to disable this behavior for certain QObjects.
/// You can do so by negative implementing this trait `unsafe impl !cxx_qt::Locking for qobject::T {}`.
///
/// However, this is unsafe, as it may lead to concurrent mutable access to the QObject from C++.
/// You are responsible for ensuring this does not happen!
//
// This could be implemented using an auto trait in the future once stable
