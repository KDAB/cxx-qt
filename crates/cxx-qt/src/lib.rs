/// # Safety
///
/// This is a marker trait used to disable locking.
///
/// By default, CXX-Qt will guard all access to the generated QObject with a recursive mutex.
/// For performance reasons it may be desirable to disable this behavior for certain QObjects.
/// You can do so by negative implementing this trait `unsafe impl !cxx_qt::Locking for T {}`.
///
/// However, this is unsafe, as it may lead to concurrent mutable access to the QObject from C++.
/// You are responsible for ensuring this does not happen!
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// #[cxx_qt::bridge]
/// mod qobject {
///     extern "RustQt" {
///         #[qobject]
///         type MyStruct = super::MyStructRust;

/// Therefore they may not be passed between threads nor accessed from multiple threads.
///
/// To achieve safe multi-threading on the Rust side we use an [CxxQtThread].
/// A [CxxQtThread] represents a reference to the Qt thread that the QObject lives in.

/// # Pseudo Code for generated C++ Constructor
/// You can imagine this trait as creating a constructor roughly like this:

/// class MyCxxQtType : public QObject {
///     public:
///         MyCxxQtType(Arguments... args)
///             : QObject(Constructor::route_arguments(args).BaseArguments)

///             Constructor::initialize(*this, Constructor::route_arguments(args).InitializeArguments);
///         }
/// }

/// will be moved, never copied.

/// # Initializing the QObject
///

///
/// The `initialize` function can be used to run code inside a constructor.
/// It is given a pinned mutable self reference to the QObject and the list of `InitializeArguments`.
///
/// ## Using the `Initialize` trait
///
/// The QML engine creates QML elements using their default constructor, so for most QML types only the `initialize` part of the constructor is of interest.
/// To reduce the boilerplate of this use-case, CXX-Qt provides the [Initialize] trait.
///
/// If a QObject implements the `Initialize` trait, and the inner Rust struct is [Default]-constructible it will automatically implement `cxx_qt::Constructor<()>`.
