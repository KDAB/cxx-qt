[features]
# When Cargo links an executable, whether a bin crate or test executable,
# and Qt 6 is linked statically, this feature must be enabled to link
# unarchived .o files with static symbols that Qt ships (for example
# to initialize Qt resources embedded within Qt libraries).
#
# CMake also links those .o files when linking Qt's targets, so this
# feature must be disabled for staticlib crates. Otherwise, linking
# will fail with duplicate symbol errors.
#
# When linking Qt dynamically, this makes no difference.
