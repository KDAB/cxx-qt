# Data Struct

The data struct defines which properties should exist on the QObject. It also allows you to provide initial values for the properties by implementing the `Default` trait.

Note that you can also use serde on the Data struct and derive `Deserialize` and `Serialize`, this then allows you deserialize and serialize the properties in the QObject.

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_features/src/data_struct_properties.rs:book_macro_code}}
```

## Default

If you want to provide default values for your QObject, then instead of deriving implement the `Default` trait for the struct `Data`.

## Deserialisation or Serialisation

Using [Serde](https://serde.rs/) the Data struct can be (de)seralised, by adding the dervive attributes as normal.

To serialise an object from a `Data` struct to a string use serde as normal on `Data` struct instances, to obtain an instance of the `Data` struct from an invokable use the `CppObj`, eg `Data::from(cpp);` as shown in the `as_json_str` invokable below.

To deseralise an object from a string to a `Data` struct use serde as normal. The two main purposes for this are implementing `Default` for `Data` or using `grab_values_from_data` on the `CppObj` as seen in the `grab_values` method.

Note that Qt types cannot be (de)seralised yet ( [https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/issues/16](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/issues/16) ).

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_features/src/serialisation.rs:book_macro_code}}
```
