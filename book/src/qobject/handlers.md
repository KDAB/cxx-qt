# Handlers

Handlers are used to react to events on the Qt event loop thread. This allows Rust to react to events from C++, process triggers from background Rust threads on the Qt foreground thread, and avoid deadlocks.

The following handlers are available

  * PropertyChangeHandler to handle when a property value has changed
  * UpdateRequestHandler to process update requests on the Qt event loop thread, see [threading](../concepts/threading.md) for more info.

## PropertyChangeHandler

When a property defined in the [data struct](./data_struct.md) is changed, either via Rust calling a setter or via QML / C++ calling a setter, we can be notified of this change by using the `PropertyChangeHandler`.

The example below listens to the number property and `handle_property_change` is triggered when the property `number` changes. It uses a `Property` enum which is automatically generated from the names of the properties defined in the [data struct](./data_struct.md).

Note that this is called from the Qt event loop thread.

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_features/src/handler_property_change.rs:book_macro_code}}
```

## UpdateRequestHandler

When a background Rust thread uses an `UpdateRequester` to request the Qt thread to synchronise via calling `request_update` this triggers the `handle_update_request` method of the `UpdateRequestHandler`.

For example in an invokable the [`CppObj`](./cpp_object.md) is used to retrieve an `UpdateRequester`.

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_with_threaded_logic/src/lib.rs:book_cpp_update_requester}}
```

The `UpdateRequester` is moved into the thread, then when required an update is requested.

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_with_threaded_logic/src/lib.rs:book_request_update}}
```

This then triggers `handle_update_request` to be called at a later stage from the Qt event loop thread. Which can iterate over an event_queue (eg a channel from the background thread), to update the values into the Qt object (via process_event with the CppObj).

Note that this is called from the Qt event loop thread.

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_with_threaded_logic/src/lib.rs:book_update_request_handler}}
```
