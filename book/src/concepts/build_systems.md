# Build Systems

CXX-Qt can be integrated into existing CMake projects or built with only cargo. The getting started guide provides documentation on how to set up your project:

- [Cargo Integration](../getting-started/4-cargo-executable.md)
- [CMake Integration](../getting-started/5-cmake-integration.md)

CXX-Qt could work with any C++ build system so long as the `QMAKE`, `CXX_QT_EXPORT_DIR` and `CXX_QT_EXPORT_CRATE_<CRATE-NAME>` environment variables are set before calling Cargo.
Take a look at our CMake code for how this can be used.
However, using C++ build systems besides Cargo or CMake with CXX-Qt is untested and the use of these environment variables is SemVer-exempt!

## `CxxQtBuilder`

With both build systems a build script (`build.rs`) file needs to be used,
so that CXX-Qt knows which files to look for bridges and to build a Qt C++ library for linking later.

See [`CxxQtBuilder` documentation](https://docs.rs/cxx-qt-build/latest/cxx_qt_build/struct.CxxQtBuilder.html) for more details.

## QML Modules

When using QML with CXX-Qt [QML modules](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-writing-a-module.html) can be output.
This allows for attributes such as `#[qml_element]` to register the `QObject` with the QML type system without any C++ code.

See [`QmlModule` documentation](https://docs.rs/cxx-qt-build/latest/cxx_qt_build/struct.QmlModule.html) for more details.
