# Types

## Primitive Trivial Types

These types can be used for properties, parameters or return types in invokables, and parameters in signals without any conversion.

They appear as their normal types on both the C++ and Rust sides of the bridge.

| Rust Type | C++ Type |
|-----------|----------|
| bool      | bool     |
| f32       | float    |
| f64       | double   |
| i8        | qint8    |
| i16       | qint16   |
| i32       | qint32   |
| u8        | quint8   |
| u16       | quint16  |
| u32       | quint32  |

TODO: Note that u64 / quint64 is not supported currently ( [https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/issues/36](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/issues/36) ).

## Custom Types

These types are custom and require special treatment when traversing the bridge, to assist with traversing the bridge we have provided helper types in the cxx_qt_lib crate.

Within these custom types there are two kinds to consider

  * Trivial
  * Opaque

### Custom Trivial Types

Custom trivial types, like primitive trival types, can be used for properties, parameters or return types in invokables, and parameters in signals without any conversion.

On the rust side they appear as the cxx_qt_lib helper type.

Note that when they are used as a parameter type in invokables they should be passed as a reference, eg `pointf: &QPointF`, and when they are a property or return type they should be a value, eg `QPointF`.

| Rust Type | C++ Type |
|-----------|----------|
| cxx_qt_lib::QDate | QDate |
| cxx_qt_lib::QPoint | QPoint |
| cxx_qt_lib::QPointF | QPointF |
| cxx_qt_lib::QRect | QRect |
| cxx_qt_lib::QRectF | QRectF |
| cxx_qt_lib::QTime | QTime |

### Custom Opaque Types

Custom opaque types wrap a unique pointer to the C++ type, they are used in the same way as custom trivial types but CXX-Qt automatically writes wrappers to convert to and from a C++ unique pointer of the type to a Rust wrapper of the type.

On the rust side they appear as the cxx_qt_lib helper type.

Note that when they are used as a parameter type in invokables they should be passed as a reference, eg `color: &QColor`, and when they are a property or return type they should be a value, eg `QColor`. Also for strings `&str` should be used when passed as a reference and `String` when passed as a value.

| Rust Type | C++ Type |
|-----------|----------|
| cxx_qt_lib::QColor | QColor |
| cxx_qt_lib::QDateTime | QDateTime |
| String or &str | QString |
| cxx_qt_lib::QUrl | QUrl |
| cxx_qt_lib::QVariant | QVariant |

An example of a QVariant as a parameter, return type, and property is shown below.

```rust,ignore,noplayground
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_features/src/types.rs:book_macro_code}}
```

## Future possible types

  * Enums
  * Lists
