# Qt

## Invokables

Invokables can be defined using the [QObject Struct](../qobject/qobject_struct.md), these will be exposed as methods on the C++ class with `Q_INVOKABLE` so that they are accessible for QML too.

## Properties

Properties can be defined using the [Data struct](../qobject/data_struct.md), these will be exposed as a getter and setter method, a changed signal, and a `Q_PROPERTY` on the C++ class and therefore as QML properties too.

## Signals

Signals can be defined using the [Signals enum](../qobject/signals_enum.md), these will be exposed as `Q_SIGNALS` on the C++ class and therefore to QML as well.
