# QObjects in Rust

There are many bits of advice like that.
With CXX-Qt, we aim to make it possible to use the right tool for each of the many jobs necessary to build a modern GUI application.

So what is in our toolbox for a typical Qt application?
- QML - A declarative, flexible, dynamically-typed, interpreted language that is purpose built to define reactive and beautiful GUI layouts and widgets with quick iteration speed.
- C++ - The traditional back-end of Qt - A fast, low-level language with a strong type system. C++ offers a rich ecosystem, many Qt-specific libraries and bare-metal performance. The cost when using C++ is that it is slow to develop, very error-prone and can easily lead to memory-issues, which can instantly crash your application and cause security issues.

Notably absent then is a back-end language that allows us to get rid of the issues C++ has and provides us with a safe way to write fast Back-end code.
This of course is where Rust comes in.
Whilst Rust doesn't have quite as rich of an ecosystem, it is typically faster to develop than C++, with easy dependency management, and most importantly, safe memory access.
Therefore it is an ideal candidate to replace C++ for writing the back-end business-logic code that feeds the GUI with data.

However, both C++ as well as QML still have their place in Qt applications.
For that reason Rust, C++ and QML should all be able to be used to complement each other.
CXX-Qt aims to make it easy to integrate all three languages easily with each other, through the use of Qts [meta object system](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/metaobjects.html).

Qts design is inherently object-oriented, which is true both for C++ and QML as well.
Therefore, in order to integrate well with Qt, Rust needs to be able to extend the Qt object system with its own QObject subclasses and instances.
This is exactly what CXX-Qt allows you to do.

As Rust doesn't offer classes with inheritance and polymorphism, CXX-Qt uses a Rust module when defining new QObject subclasses.

These CXX-Qt modules consist of multiple parts:
- A `Data` struct
    - Defines which Properties will be in the QObject subclass.
    - Needs to implement the `Default` trait.
    - This data will live in a C++ subclass that is generated from the CXX-Qt module
- A `RustObj` struct
    - A normal Rust struct
    - One struct instance is created per class instance
    - Contains any Rust-only data
- The `impl` of the `RustObj` struct (optional):
    - Contains any Rust code
    - Functions marked with `#[invokable]` will be callable from QML and C++

CXX-Qt will then expand this Rust module into two separate parts:
1. A C++ subclass of QObject with the same name as the module
2. The Rust struct `RustObj`

CXX-Qt also generates the code needed for interaction of the C++ QObject subclass and the `RustObj` struct using the [CXX library](https://cxx.rs/).
For more details, see the [Concepts: Bridge](../concepts/bridge.md) page.
CXX-Qt also wraps some Qt types for us, so they can be easily used by the Rust side.
See the [Concepts: Qt Types](../concepts/types.md) page for the list of available types.

The important take away here is the duality of any subclass generated by CXX-Qt.
They always contain the actual QObject subclass that exists purely on the C++ side.
Every instance of these QObject subclasses then contains an instance of the `RustObj` struct.
The lifetime and GUI data is therefore managed by the QObject instance and exists on the C++ side.
Typically this will be instantiated by QML and the lifetime will be directly associated with the corresponding QML widget.

However, the generated QObject subclass will defer to the `RustObj` struct for any behavior, which is defined in Rust.
The `RustObj` struct can expose additional functionality with functions marked as `#[invokable]`, which will generate a function on the C++ side that will directly call the appropriate Rust method.
These Rust methods can take a reference to the data on the C++ side, so it can be modified by the Rust code.

Now that we have taken a look the theory of it all, lets jump in and write [our first CXX-Qt module](./2-our-first-cxx-qt-module.md).
