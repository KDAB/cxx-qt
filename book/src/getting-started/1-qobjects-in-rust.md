# QObjects in Rust

There are many bits of advice like that.
With CXX-Qt, we aim to make it possible to use the right tool for each of the many jobs necessary to build a modern GUI application.

So what is in our toolbox for a typical Qt application?
- QML - A declarative, flexible, dynamically-typed, interpreted language that is purpose built to define reactive and beautiful GUI layouts and widgets with quick iteration speed.
- C++ - The traditional back-end of Qt - A fast, low-level language with a strong type system. C++ offers a rich ecosystem, many Qt-specific libraries and bare-metal performance. The cost when using C++ is that it is slow to develop, very error-prone and can easily lead to memory-issues, which can instantly crash your application and cause security issues.

Notably absent then is a back-end language that allows us to get rid of the issues C++ has and provides us with a safe way to write fast back-end code.
This of course is where Rust comes in.
Whilst Rust doesn't have quite as rich of an ecosystem, it is typically faster to develop than C++, with easy dependency management, and most importantly, safe memory access.
Therefore it is an ideal candidate to replace C++ for writing the back-end business-logic code that feeds the GUI with data.

However, C++ as well as QML still have their place in Qt applications.
For that reason Rust, C++, and QML should all be able to be used to complement each other.
CXX-Qt aims to make it easy to integrate all three languages with each other, through the use of Qt's [meta object system](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/metaobjects.html) and [CXX](https://cxx.rs).

As CXX-Qt is largely an expansion on top of CXX, you should make yourself familiar with CXX first.
You can read their excellent documentation here:

CXX already provides idiomatic interaction between C++ and Rust, from Rust, as well as from C++.
CXX-Qt builds on this foundation, to allow you to define Qt-specific concepts in Rust.

These concepts include:
- Custom QObject classes
    - Properties
    - Invokables/Slots
- Signals

As with CXX, to use these features you mark a Rust module with an attribute macro (`#[cxx_qt::bridge]`).
Then you can use the afformentioned features with the help of more macros.
- `#[cxx_qt::qobject]` - Expose a Rust struct to Qt as a QObject subclass.
    - `#[qproperty]` - Expose a field of the Rust struct to QML/C++ as a [`Q_PROPERTY`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-cppintegration-exposecppattributes.html#exposing-properties).
    - `#[qinvokable]` - Expose a function on the QObject to QML and C++ as a [`Q_INVOKABLE`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-cppintegration-exposecppattributes.html#exposing-methods-including-qt-slots).
    - `#[qsignal]` - Define the [Signals](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/signalsandslots.html#signals) of a QObject T.

CXX-Qt will then expand this Rust module into two separate parts:
- C++ files that define a QObject subclass for each `#[cxx_qt::qobject]` marked struct.
- The Rust code for the `#[cxx_qt::qobject]` marked Rust struct

CXX-Qt also generates the code needed for interaction of the C++ QObject subclass and the `#[cxx_qt::qobject]` marked struct using the [CXX library](https://cxx.rs/).
For more details, see the [Concepts: Bridge](../concepts/bridge.md) page.

The important take away here is the duality of any subclass generated by CXX-Qt.
These classes are made up of the actual QObject subclass instance that C++ interacts with, as well as an instance of the `#[cxx_qt::qobject]` marked struct on the Rust side.
When such a QObject is instantiated, it will always also construct an instance of the Rust struct as well.
The lifetime of the Rust struct will be bound to that of the QObject.
If the QObject is deleted, the Rust struct will be deleted as well.
Typically this will be instantiated by QML and the lifetime will be directly associated with the corresponding QML item.

The generated QObject subclass will then defer to the Rust struct for any behavior, which is then defined in Rust.
For example, using the `#[qinvokable]` attribute, we can define functions that will be exposed to C++, but will execute Rust code.
Also, any fields in the Rust struct marked with `#[qproperty]` will be exposed to Qt as `Q_PROPERTY` fields.
Therefore allowing you to assign them from QML as well.

But enough theory for now, lets jump in and write [our first CXX-Qt module](./2-our-first-cxx-qt-module.md).
