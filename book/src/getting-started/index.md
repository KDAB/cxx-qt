# CXX-Qt - Getting Started

In comparison to other Qt-Rust-bindings, CXX-Qt does not aim to simply expose Qt functionality to Rust, but rather to completely integrate Rust into the Qt ecosystem.

In this guide we'll go through a minimal, but complete example that uses CXX-Qt to create your own QObject in Rust and integrate it with a small QML-based GUI.
As CXX-Qt aims to integrate Rust into the existing Qt ecosystem, you should have basic knowledge of Qt and QML before attempting to follow this guide.
If you're not familiar with Qt/QML yet, take a look at the [Qt Getting started guide](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html) or the [QML intro](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlapplications.html) respectively.

During this getting-started guide we'll first take a look at how CXX-Qt integrates with Qt's object system to allow the [definition of QObjects in Rust](./1-qobjects-in-rust.md).
Then we'll dive straight into practice and define our first [QObject as a Rust module](./2-our-first-cxx-qt-module.md).
Once we've done that, its time to [expose the defined QObject to QML](./3-exposing-to-qml.md).
Followed by actually [defining our GUI using QML](./4-qml-gui.md).

We will show two different ways to build the project.
First, we will show how to integrate cxx-qt into a C++ application by [building with CMake](./5-cmake-integration.md).
We will also demonstrate how to build the same cxx-qt code [as a Rust executable](./6-cargo-executable.md) without requiring a C++ build system.

Note we only support 64-bit x86 Linux, but we plan on adding arm 64-bit, macOS, and Windows support in the future.

So, without further ado - let's [Get Started](./1-qobjects-in-rust.md)
