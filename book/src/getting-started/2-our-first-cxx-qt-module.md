# Our first CXX-Qt module

As with all things Rust, we'll want to create a cargo project, run the following command inside the `tutorial` folder to initialize the Rust part of the project.

```shell
$ cargo new qml_minimal
$ cd qml_minimal
```

As outlined in the previous section, to use CXX-Qt, we'll create a Rust module within this crate.
This Rust module will then serve as our interface between Qt and Rust.
First, in the `src/main.rs`, we tell Cargo about the module we're about to create:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/lib.rs:book_mod_statement}}
```

Now, we need to create a file `rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs` for that module.
It will include our `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` that allows us to interact with Qt concepts.

This is a lot to take in, so let's go one step at a time.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_cxx_qt_module}}
```

## CXX-Qt bridge module

Starting with the module definition:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_bridge_macro}}
    // ...
}
```

A `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` is the same as a `#[cxx::bridge]` and you can use all features of CXX in it.
Additionally, a `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` gives you a few more features that allow you to create `QObject`s from Rust or declare existing `QObject`s for access from Rust.

## `extern "RustQt"`

Like `extern "Rust"` and `extern "C++"` in CXX, CXX-Qt provides `extern "RustQt"` and `extern "C++Qt"`.

These `extern` blocks instruct CXX-Qt to where the implementation of our interface lives.
Anything that is marked as `extern "RustQt"` is implemented in Rust and will be exposed to C++.
Conversely, anything inside `extern "C++Qt"` is implemented in C++ and will be exposed to Rust.

## `QObject` struct

First we will create a new `QObject` subclass.
As we want to implement it in Rust, we need to place our interface inside `extern "RustQt"`.

To create a new `QObject` subclass that will be defined in Rust, use a type-alias and mark it with `#[qobject]`.
In our case the new class will be named `MyObject` and will be backed by a Rust `struct` named `MyObjectRust`.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_rustobj_struct_signature}}
```

The Rust struct must be defined **outside** the bridge module and is therefore referred to using `super::`.
This just needs to be a normal Rust `struct` and can contain any kind of field, even Rust-only types that are not compatible with CXX.

Unless we want to use CXX-Qt's [Constructor feature](https://docs.rs/cxx-qt/latest/cxx_qt/trait.Constructor.html) we just need to ensure that this `struct` implements Rusts `Default` trait
In this case we just use `#[derive(Default)]` on the `struct`.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_rustobj_struct}}
```

Now the `#[qobject]` macro will take care of creating a new `QObject` subclass named `MyObject`.
Every instance of that class will also include an instance of the `MyObjectRust` struct that the `MyObject` class will defer to for any data or behavior.

To automatically export this new class to QML, we mark it with the `#[qml_element]` attribute.
This is the same as specifying [`QML_ELEMENT`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qqmlengine.html#QML_ELEMENT) in C++.
This takes the place of the [qt_add_qml_module CMake function](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qt-add-qml-module.html)
(because that doesn't work with CXX-Qt's build system).

The `#[qproperty]` attribute will create a [`Q_PROPERTY`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/properties.html) for the given type and field name.
CXX-Qt will then:

1. Create the `Q_PROPERTY` on the `QObject` type.
2. Create a `NOTIFY` signal for when the property changes.
3. Generate getters and setters that use the underlying Rust fields and emit the NOTIFY signal on changes.

In this case the newly created `QObject` subclass will have two properties: `number` and `string`.
CXX-Qt expects a field for each property to exist in the underlying Rust `struct`.
For names that contain multiple words, like `my_number`, CXX-Qt will automatically rename the field from snake_case to camelCase to fit with C++/QML naming conventions (e.g. `myNumber`).

### Types

Please note that any fields exposed as `#[qproperty]` must have types that CXX can translate to C++ types.
In our case that means:

- `#[qproperty(i32, number)]` ⇾ `Q_PROPERTY(::std::int32_t number ...)`
- `#[qproperty(QString, string)` ⇾ `Q_PROPERTY(QString string ...)`

For `i32`, CXX-Qt already knows how to translate it.
A `QString` however is unknown to CXX.
Luckily, the [`cxx_qt_lib`](https://docs.rs/cxx-qt-lib/latest/cxx_qt_lib/) crate already wraps many Qt types for us.
We can just include them in the bridge like any other CXX type:

``` rust, ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_qstring_import}}
```

For more details on the available types, see the [Qt types page](../concepts/types.md).

-------

CXX-Qt will then automatically generate a new `QObject` subclass called `MyObject` and expose it as an [`extern "C++"` opaque type](https://cxx.rs/extern-c++.html#opaque-c-types) back to Rust.
In our case, this means we can refer to the C++ `QObject` as `qobject::MyObject`, as it is defined inside the `mod qobject`.

This type can be used like any other CXX opaque type.

## Invokables

Additionally, CXX-Qt allows us to add functionality to this `QObject` by referring to the type as the self type of functions in an `extern "RustQt"` block.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_rustobj_invokable_signature}}
```

This works the same as exposing any other [member function with CXX](https://cxx.rs/extern-rust.html#methods) in an `extern "Rust"` block.
Additionally, CXX-Qt understands the `#[qinvokable]` attribute and marks the member function as [`Q_INVOKABLE`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-cppintegration-exposecppattributes.html#exposing-methods-including-qt-slots).
This means they can be called from QML.

These functions then need to be implemented outside the bridge using `impl qobject::MyObject`.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_rustobj_invokable_impl}}
```

This setup is a bit unusual, as the type `qobject::MyObject` is actually defined in C++.
However, it is still possible to add member functions to it in Rust and then expose them back to C++.
This is the usual workflow for `QObject`s in CXX-Qt.
CXX-Qt will define the `QObject` class itself in C++, but defer to Rust for any behavior.

> Note that we recommend calling the bridge module `qobject` instead of the CXX-typical `ffi`.
> This way accessing the C++ `QObject` outside the bridge becomes a natural `qobject::MyObject`
> instead of `ffi::MyObject`.
>
> Feel free to choose any module name you like though.

Also do not forget to import everything required for the invokable implementation.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/cxxqt_object.rs:book_use}}
```

In our case, we define two new functions:

- `increment_number`
  - Increments the number of the `MyObject`.
  - The name will be converted to `incrementNumber` in C++.
- `say_hello`
  - Prints a provided number and string.
  - The name will be converted to `sayHello` in C++.

Because we are implementing on the `qobject::MyObject` type instead of the `MyObject` type, `self` here is the C++ `QObject` that is generated from our `MyObject` struct.
As this type is a CXX Opaque type, we can't actually instantiate it.
Our Qt code will take care of this.
Also, we can't move the `QObject`, which is why it is behind a Rust [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/struct.Pin.html).

CXX-Qt will generate getters and setters for all properties of our `struct`.
That's where the `number()` and `set_number()` functions used by `increment_number()` come from.
For more details on what you can do with the `QObject` from Rust and what functions CXX-Qt will generate for you, take a look at the [`QObject` page](../concepts/generated_qobject.md).

And that's it. We've defined our first `QObject` subclass in Rust. That wasn't so hard, was it?

Now let's get to [using it in Qt](./3-qml-gui.md).
