# Building with CMake

In this example, we will demonstrate how to integrate cxx-qt code into a C++ application. Cargo builds the cxx-qt code
as a static library, then CMake links it into a C++ executable.

## Cargo setup
Before we can get started on building Qt with CMake, we first need to make our Cargo build ready for it.
If you've generated your project with the `cargo new --lib` command, your `Cargo.toml` likely looks something like this:
```toml,ignore
[package]
name = "qml-minimal"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

We'll have to do multiple things:
- Instruct cargo to create a staticlib
- Add `cxx`, `cxx-qt`, as well as `cxx-qt-lib` as dependencies
- Add `cxx-qt-build` as a build dependency

In the end, your `Cargo.toml` should look similar to this (note that `path` for the dependencies is only
needed for the example within the cxx-qt repository; in your project you'd use the version from crates.io):
```toml,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/Cargo.toml:book_all}}
```

We'll then also need to add a script named `build.rs` next to our `Cargo.toml`:
```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/build.rs:book_build_rs}}
```
This is what generates the C++ code for our `MyObject` class at compile-time.
It will output the `cxx-qt-gen/include/my_object.h` file we included earlier in `main.cpp`.

Note that all Rust source files that uses the `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` macro need to be included in this script!
In our case, this is only the `src/cxxqt_object.rs` file.

## CMake setup

Start the CMakeLists.txt file like any other C++ project using Qt. For this example, we are [supporting both
Qt5 and Qt6 with CMake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-qt5-and-qt6-compatibility.html):

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_setup}}
```

From the Qt CMake target, find the location of the qmake executable. cxx-qt-build will need this later.
```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_find_qmake}}
```

Locate [Corrosion](https://github.com/corrosion-rs/corrosion), a tool for integrating Rust libraries into CMake.
If Corrosion is not installed, automatically download it:

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_find_corrosion}}
```

Use Corrosion to create a CMake library target for the Rust library. cxx-qt requires a few more steps beyond using
a typical Rust library with Corrosion:
```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_use_corrosion}}
```

Finally, create the CMake executable target and link it to the Rust library:

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_executable}}
```

Build the project like any other CMake project:

```shell
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
```
If this fails for any reason, take a look at the [`examples/qml_minimal`](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/tree/main/examples/qml_minimal) folder, which contains the complete example code.

This should now configure and compile our project.
If this was successful, you can now run our little project.
```shell
$ build/qml_minimal
```

You should now see the two Labels that display the state of our `MyObject`, as well as the two buttons to call our two Rust functions.

## Success   ðŸ¥³

For further reading, you can take a look at the [QObject chapter](../qobject/index.md) which goes into detail about all features that CXX-Qt exposes to new QObject subclasses.
As well as the [Concepts chapter](../concepts/index.md), which explains the under concepts underlying CXX-Qt.
