# Building with CMake

In this example, we will demonstrate how to integrate CXX-Qt code into a C++ application using CMake.
Cargo builds the CXX-Qt code as a static library, then CMake links it into a C++ executable.

> If you don't want to use CMake, and only want to use Cargo to build your project, refer to the [previous section](./4-cargo-executable.md).

We'll first want to modify our project structure to separate the different parts of our project.

```ignore
tutorial
  - cpp
  - qml
  - rust
```

Move the rust project into the `rust` folder.
Pull out the `qml` folder back to the top level.

## C++ executable

To start our QML application, we'll need a small `main.cpp` file with an ordinary `main` function. Puts this in a `cpp` folder to clearly separate the C++ and Rust code:

```cpp,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/cpp/main.cpp:book_main_cpp}}
```

You can add as much C++ code as you want in addition to this.

## Using Rust QObjects in C++

For every `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` that we define in Rust, CXX-Qt will generate a corresponding C++ header file.
They will always be in the `cxx-qt-gen/` include path and use the snake_case naming convention.
The name of the header file will be the name of the Rust module of your `#[cxx_qt::bridge]`, followed by `.cxxqt.h`.
So in our case: `#include cxx-qt-gen/qobject.cxxqt.h`

> Note that the [`cxx_file_stem`](../bridge/index.md#cxx_file_stem) option can be specified in the bridge macro to choose the file name.

Including the generated header allows accessing the `MyObject` C++ class, just like any other C++ class.
Inherit from it, connect signals and slots to it, put it in a QVector, do whatever you want with it.
That's the power of CXX-Qt.

## Cargo setup

Before we can get started on building Qt with CMake, we first need to make our Cargo build ready for it.
If you've generated your project with the `cargo new --lib` or `cargo init --lib [folder]` command, your `Cargo.toml` should look something like this:

```toml,ignore
[package]
name = "qml_minimal"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
```

We'll have to do multiple things:

- Instruct cargo to create a static library
- Add `cxx`, `cxx-qt`, as well as `cxx-qt-lib` as dependencies
- Add `cxx-qt-build` as a build dependency

> If you've already followed the Cargo setup, most of this should already be done.
> Make sure to change the `crate-type` to `"staticlib"` though!

In the end, your `Cargo.toml` should look similar to this.

```toml,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/Cargo.toml:book_static_lib}}

[dependencies]
cxx = "1.0.95"
cxx-qt = "0.6"
cxx-qt-lib = "0.6"

# cxx-qt-build generates C++ code from the `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` module
# and compiles it together with the Rust static library
[build-dependencies]
cxx-qt-build = "0.6"

[features]
# This feature must be enabled for `cargo test` when linking Qt 6 statically.
link_qt_object_files = [ "cxx-qt-build/link_qt_object_files" ]
```

We'll then also need to add a script named `build.rs` next to the `Cargo.toml`:
> If you've already followed the Cargo build tutorial, simply modify the existing `build.rs` file.

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/build.rs:book_build_rs}}
```

This is what generates and compiles the C++ code for our `MyObject` class at build time.

Every Rust source file that uses the `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` macro need to be included in this script.
In our case, this is only the `src/cxxqt_object.rs` file.

This is also where the QML module is defined with a QML URI and version.
The files and resources in the module are then exposed in the same way as the [qt_add_qml_module CMake function](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qt-add-qml-module.html).

> Note that in order for CXX-Qt to work, the `qmake` executable must be located. This is because CXX-Qt relies on `qmake` to locate the necessary Qt libraries and header files on your system.
>
> This will be done in the `CMakeLists.txt` file by setting the `QMAKE` environment variable from CMake, ensuring that CMake and Cargo use the same Qt binaries.

We'll also need to remove the `src/main.rs` and replace it with a `src/lib.rs` file.
This file only needs to include a single line:

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/rust/src/lib.rs:book_mod_statement}}
```

This simply ensures that our rust module is included in our library.

Feel free to add additional rust modules in your library as well.

## CMake setup

Now add a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root of your project folder.
Start the `CMakeLists.txt` file like any other C++ project using Qt.
For this example, we are [supporting both Qt5 and Qt6 with CMake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-qt5-and-qt6-compatibility.html):

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_setup}}
```

Locate [Corrosion](https://github.com/corrosion-rs/corrosion), a tool for integrating Rust libraries into CMake.
If Corrosion is not installed, automatically download it:

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_find_corrosion}}
```

To ensure that cxx-qt-build uses the same version of Qt as your CMake targets, use the `Qt` CMake target to locate the qmake executable. Then, pass `qmake` executable path to `build.rs` with the environment variable `QMAKE` using `corrosion_set_env_vars`.

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_find_qmake}}
```

Use Corrosion to create a CMake library target for the Rust library. CXX-Qt requires a few more steps beyond using
a typical Rust library with Corrosion:

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_use_corrosion}}
```

Finally, create the CMake executable target and link it to the Rust library:

```cmake,ignore
{{#include ../../../examples/qml_minimal/CMakeLists.txt:book_cmake_executable}}
```

Your project should now have a structure similar to this:

```console, ignore
$ tree -I target/ -I tests
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── cpp
│   └── main.cpp
├── qml
│   └── main.qml
└── rust
    ├── build.rs
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        ├── cxxqt_object.rs
        └── lib.rs

5 directories, 7 files
```

Build the project like any other CMake project:

```shell
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
```

If this fails for any reason, take a look at the [`examples/qml_minimal`](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/tree/main/examples/qml_minimal) folder, which contains the complete example code.

This should now configure and compile our project.
If this was successful, you can now run our little project.

```shell
$ build/examples/qml_minimal/example_qml_minimal
```

You should now see the two Labels that display the state of our `MyObject`, as well as the two buttons to call our two Rust functions.

### Windows with MSVC

If you're building CXX-Qt on Windows using MSVC generator, you need to ensure that `set(CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreadedDLL")` is set in CMake (or use the `-DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreadedDLL` flag) when building with the `Debug` configuration. This flag is necessary to ensure that the correct C Runtime Library is used. Then you can build using `cmake --build build --config Debug`.

This issue is caused by a bug in the [cc](https://docs.rs/cc/latest/cc/index.html) crate (as described in [this pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs/pull/717)), which has not been merged yet. Specifically, the problem is that cc generated code always links to the MultiThreaded runtime, even when building in Debug mode. We hope that this step won't be necessary in the future, once the cc crate fix is merged and released.
