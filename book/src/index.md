# CXX-Qt - Safe interop between Rust and Qt

This library provides a safe mechanism for bridging between Qt code and Rust code in a different way to typical Rust Qt bindings.

We acknowledge that Qt code and Rust code have different idioms so cannot be directly wrap from one to another.

Instead of one-to-one bindings we use [CXX](https://cxx.rs/) to [bridge](./concepts/bridge.md) between, this allows for normal Qt code and normal Rust code.

We feel this is more powerful than typical bindings as this allows us to provide a safe API and safe [multi-threading](./concepts/threading.md) between Qt and Rust.

To aid integration of Qt and Rust code we provide common [Qt types](./concepts/types.md) for Rust which can pass across the bridge and provide ways to express common [Qt idioms](./concepts/qt.md).

Through the use of macros and code generation as seen in the figure below, the developer describes a `QObject` with CXX-Qt macro annotations. Then CXX-Qt generates the C++ representation of the object and uses macro expansion to define the [CXX](https://cxx.rs/) bridge for the interop between C++ and Rust.

If you are new to CXX-Qt, we recommend you visit our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/index.md).

To get detailed information on which features of a QObject are available in CXX-Qt, see the [QObject chapter](./qobject/index.md).
Should you be interested in a deeper dive into the concepts of CXX-Qt, take a look at the [concepts chapter](./concepts/index.md), which explains the concepts CXX-Qt introduces in detail.

**Note:** CXX-Qt is tested on CI on Linux, Windows, and macOS (all on x86). It should work on other platforms that Qt and Rust both support, however, these are not tested regularly.
