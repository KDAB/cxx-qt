// We only use pointers to C types here so we don't care what the types actually contain.
// Unfortunately giving names to the C types here doesn't provide any type safety during
// pointer type casts, it only looks better than using c_void.

// The reason we use a pointer to a QPointer instead of allowing for one to be allocated
// on the stack as in our QString wrapper is to allow for UpdateRequester instances to be
// movable. Using a pointer comes at the cost of having an extra level of indirection,
// but it is unavoidable as we need to be able to move these things between threads.
