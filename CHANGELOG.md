The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.6.0...HEAD)

### Added

- Support for further types: `QLine`, `QLineF`, `QImage`, `QPainter`, `QFont`, `QPen`, `QPolygon`, `QPolygonF`, `QRegion`
- `internal_pointer_mut()` function on `QModelIndex`
- `c_void` in CXX-Qt-lib for easy access to `void *`
- `CxxQtThread` is now marked as `Sync` so that it can be used by reference
- Add cxx-qt-lib-extras crate which contains: `QCommandLineOption`, `QCommandLineParser`, `QElapsedTimer`

### Changed

- `VCPKG` is now set to off by default and packages are only built in release mode in the cache
- Connection now return a `QMetaObjectConnectionGuard` and `QMetaObjectConnection` is a separate type
- Internal `cxx-qt` headers have moved to the namespace `cxxqt1` and the folder `cxx-qt`
- `cxx-qt-gen` now does not generate code requiring `cxx-qt-lib`, this allows for `cxx-qt-lib` to be optional
- `cxx-qt-lib` headers must be given to `cxx-qt-build` with `.with_opts(cxx_qt_lib_headers::build_opts())`
- File name is used for CXX bridges rather than module name to match upstream
- `#[qobject]` attribute is now optional on types in `extern "RustQt"`
- `#[qobject]` attribute is now required on types in `extern "C++Qt"`

### Fixed

- Missing include for `MaybeLockGuard` when using only `extern "C++Qt"` signals

### Removed

- `qt_gui` and `qt_qml` features from `cxx-qt-build` they are only used in `cxx-qt-lib(-headers)` now

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.5.3...v0.6.0) - 2023-11-17

### Added

- Allow associated constants, types and macro invocations within `impl qobject::T` blocks
- Ensure that generated Rust code works when `#![deny(missing_docs)]` is enabled
- Ability to connect and disconnect from signals in Rust triggering a function pointer or closure
- `unsafe impl !cxx_qt::Locking for qobject::T` to disable internal locking
- `Deref` is now implemented for `qobject::T` to reach the `T` Rust struct
- Support for C++ only methods by not having a `#[qinvokable]` attribute
- Ability to define a custom C++ Constructor using `cxx_qt::Constructor`
- `cxx_qt::Initialize` trait for easier default-constructor implementation
- `extern "C++Qt"` block support for declaring existing types with methods and signals
- `#[qenum]` attribute for `Q_ENUM` and `Q_ENUM_NS` support
- `qnamespace!` macro to support exposing namespaced enums to QML

### Changed

- Pretty-print errors messages when build script fails
- `QDateTime` API to use `current_date_time` rather than `current_date`
- Always call `qt_build_utils::setup_linker()` in `CxxQtBuilder` and remove the proxy method
- Moved to `syn` 2.0 internally and for any exported `syn` types
- `impl cxx_qt::Threading for qobject::T` now needs to be specified for `qt_thread()` to be available
- `#[cxx_qt::qsignals]` and `#[cxx_qt::inherit]` are now used in an `extern "RustQt"` block as `#[qsignal]` and `#[inherit]`
- `#[qinvokable]` is now defined as a signature in `extern "RustQt"`
- `rust_mut` is now safe to call
- `#[qproperty]` is now defined as an attribute on the qobject rather than the field
- QObject struct is now split between the bridge and implementation outside via a type alias
- `qobject` module is no longer generated
- `impl cxx_qt::trait for qobject::T` inside the bridge is now `impl cxx_qt::trait for T`
- `qobject::T` as the self parameter in the bridge is now `T`
- `#[cxx_override]`, `#[cxx_final]`, `#[cxx_virtual]` are now independant attributes rather than embedded in `#[qinvokable]`
- Use `set_organization_name` instead of `q{core,gui}application_set_organization_name` in cxx-qt-lib

### Fixed

- Do not use -bundle otherwise CMake builds are missing qt-static-initalizers (note this is broken in rustc 1.69)
- Do not import `Pin` in hidden module as invokables are outside now, resolving IDE integration
- Rust always links against a non-debug Windows runtime with *-msvc targets, so we need to link to MultiThreadedDLL

### Removed

- Removed support for `cxx_type` and `cxx_return_type` and related conversion methods.
- Removed `newCppObject` function that allowed creation of default-constructed QObject from Rust.
- Generation of getter and setter for private Rust fields
- Generation of mutable getter for properties, instead use `rust_mut`

## [0.5.3](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3) - 2023-05-19

### Fixed

- Ensure that QVariant{Hash,List,Map} cxx-qt-lib equivalents are registered so that they work in QML
- Stop generating `mut` on self pins unnecessarily

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2) - 2023-04-27

### Fixed

- Builds failing due to `link modifiers combination +bundle,+whole-archive is unstable when generating rlibs`

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1) - 2023-03-27

### Fixed

- `qrc` resources added to `CxxQtBuilder` or `QtBuild` now trigger `cargo:rerun-if-changed` for file entries
- Fix not being able to use `QVariant` as a `#[qproperty]`, because the `PartialEq` implementation was missing

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) - 2023-03-08

## Added

- Register QML types at build time: `#[cxxqt::qobject(qml_uri = "foo.bar", qml_version = "1.0")]`
- Register QRC resources at build time in Cargo builds (don't need to call initialization function from Rust `main` function)

- Support for further types: `QByteArray`, `QCoreApplication`, `QGuiApplication`, `QMargins`, `QMarginsF`, `QModelIndex`, `QPersistentModelIndex`, `QQmlApplicationEngine`, `QQmlEngine`, `QStringList`, `QTimeZone`, `QVector2D`, `QVector3D`, `QVector4D`
- Support for nesting objects in properties, invokables, and signals with `*mut T`
- Allow for marking signals as existing in the base class

- Add several quality of life functions to builtin cxx-qt-lib types, including `Default` constructors, string formatting, `std::cmp` order and operators

### Changed

- `QVariant` now has a uses a `QVariantValue` trait for supported types, allowing custom types to be used with QVariant

### Fixed

- Support for generating correct C++ code for `Pin<T>` Rust types
- Support namespace attribute on shared types, QObject struct, and extern blocks
- Asserts for 32bit platforms such as Wasm
