## [Unreleased](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.4.1...HEAD)

## Added

- Support for container types: `QSet<T>`, `QHash<K, V>`, `QList<T>`, `QMap<K, V>`, `QVector<T>`
- Support for further types: `QByteArray`, `QModelIndex`, `QPersistentModelIndex`, `QStringList`, `QVector2D`, `QVector3D`, `QVector4D`
- Support for nesting objects in properties, invokables, and signals with `*mut T`

### Changed

- `QVariant` now has a uses a `QVariantValue` trait for supported types, allowing custom types to be used with QVariant
- `QtGui` types in cxx-qt-lib are now behind a feature `qt_gui` and `Gui` needs to enabled as a `qt_module` in `CxxQtBuilder`

### Fixed

- Support for generating correct C++ code for `Pin<T>` Rust types
- Support namespace attribute on shared types, QObject struct, and extern blocks

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) - 2022-11-18

### Added

- Multiple QObjects can be defined in one bridge

### Fixed

### Added

- Addition of qt-build-utils crate
- Add generic system for performing type conversions in C++

### Changed

- Refactor of API so that CXX-Qt is a superset of CXX
- Rewrite of build system, removal of custom cmake file, corrosion is used for CMake and support for building with only Cargo
- Refactor of internal generation code so it's split into stages and removal of pattern matching for types, so arbritary CXX types can be supported
- Mark Qt relocatable types as trivial to CXX
- Use Rust closures to queue tasks onto the Qt thread

### Removed

- Support for nested objects

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0) - 2022-06-10

### Added

- Add vcpkg for Windows and macOS, then use this for CI
- Support mutable invokables

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) - 2022-02-28

### Added

- Add more Qt types, QDate, QDateTime, Qpoint, QRect, QRectF, QSize, QTime, QUrl
- Support Qt 6 for Qt types
- Use a "CppObj" to represent the C++ context
- Add a book for documentation

### Changed

- Use postEvent for emitting events safely
## [0.1.0](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2021-12-03

### Added
